<p>My original intent here was to provide simple samples that are easier to
	understand than the complete working program samples typical of the MSDN,
	but I have put a variety of other stuff here too. Originally most of the
	material here used C++ and Windows but there is a variety of other content
	too. I do prefer to keep things simple and that can be especially helpful
	for samples. This web site is the result of my assistance in various forums.</p>

<p>I have 25 articles in the<a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com"> C# Corner</a> 
	web site at <a href="http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/members/sam-hobbs/articles">
	Sam Hobbs's Articles</a> about C# programming and some other subjects.</p>
