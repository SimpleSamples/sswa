<p>MFC frame window titles consist of a document name and
	an application name. The format &quot;application name - document name&quot;
	is used if the FWS_ADDTOTITLE frame window style is set (the default is
	for it to be set).
	The <span class="op">FWS_PREFIXTITLE</span> frame window style causes the title
	to be reversed so that the document name is before the application name.</p>

<h2>Document Name</h2>

<p>If there is a need to change
the document name dynamically during execution, then it can be changed using
CDocument::SetTitle, which will call OnUpdateFrameTitle to effect the change for each view of the
document.</p>

<h2>Application Name</h2>

<p>If you
want the main window caption to consist only of the application name then remove
the FWS_ADDTOTITLE frame window style by doing the following in an
override of the PreCreateWindow() function in the MainFrame class:</p>

  <pre style="background-color: #E1E1E1">cs.style &amp;= ~FWS_ADDTOTITLE;</pre>

<p>If, after a project has been generated by the AppWizard, the application name needs to be modified
permanently, then see Microsoft Knowledge Base article <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q129/0/95.asp">Q129095 - INFO:
Format of the Document Template String</a> for a description of how to modify the
windowTitle string.</p>

<p>There is not, however, a  way to change the application
name for window titles as easily as for document names, but fortunately it is almost as easy. The application name is stored in the protected m_strTitle member variable of CFrameWnd. So to change it anytime after the
window has been created, create a member function in your CFrameWnd or CMDIFrameWnd
derived class, as in the following:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #E1E1E1">void CMainFrame::SetAppName(LPCTSTR Title) {
m_strTitle = Title;
}</pre>

<p>Then to change the application name in the window title, you must first call
SetAppName, but then it is necessary to call OnUpdateFrameTitle to ensure the
change is applied. Assuming that SetAppName is a public member function, the
application name in the main frame's window title can be changed from anywhere
after it has been created. For example, something such as the following could be
used to change it from the view:</p>

<pre style="background-color: #E1E1E1">CMainFrame *pFrame=(CMainFrame*)GetParent();
pFrame-&gt;SetAppName(&quot;New Application Name&quot;);
pFrame-&gt;OnUpdateFrameTitle(TRUE);</pre>

<p>However for that to work, you must have the FWS_ADDTOTITLE frame window style 
set; that is the default, so normally that is not a problem.</p>

<p>If you need to modify a frame window's title in a more customized manner,
then the documentation of how to do that is scattered and
confusing. The OnUpdateFrameTitle function is likely included in the solution,
so search for descriptions of overriding OnUpdateFrameTitle.</p>
